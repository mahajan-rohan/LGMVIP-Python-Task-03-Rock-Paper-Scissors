# 🎮Task 3 Python project: Rock-Paper-Scissors Game while I was intern at LetsGrowMore ! 🪨📄✂️

## 🔍 Project Overview:
 I've developed an interactive and engaging Rock-Paper-Scissors game using Python and Tkinter. This game features a dynamic GUI and provides a fun user experience with responsive visuals and real-time score updates.

## ✨ Key Features:

- Interactive Gameplay: Users can select Rock, Paper, or Scissors, and the game instantly displays the computer's choice along with the result.

- Visual Feedback: Displays images corresponding to the choices made by the user and the computer.

- Dynamic Results Display: Shows the result of each round clearly, indicating whether the user won, lost, or tied.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used:

- Python: The core programming language powering the application.

- Tkinter: For building a responsive and visually appealing graphical user interface.

- PIL (Pillow): For handling and displaying images in the GUI.

- OS Module: Ensures smooth handling of file paths and resources.
